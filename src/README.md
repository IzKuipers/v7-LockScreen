# ArcMac Lockscreen

A lockscreen designed for the ArcOS iMac. I've decided to make it available to all ArcOS users by removing the electron restrictions. To use this application, simply open it, and click the lock icon in the bottom right of the start menu. Batteries not included.

This application pairs wonderfully with the ArcMac Screensaver, which is another app I wrote for the iMac to add a screensaver.

## Startup items

If you want to add this to your startup when using both the screensaver and lockscreen, be sure to add the lockscreen first, and then the screensaver. If the order is flipped, the screensaver will render below the lockscreen, making it uneffective. So, the order should be this:

- IzK_ScreenLocker - App
- IzK_Screensaver - App

## WARNING

This is NOT a security feature!! Anyone can easily bypass the restrictions put in place by this app by opening developer tools. This application is nifty more than anything else. **DO NOT rely on this app for your security**.

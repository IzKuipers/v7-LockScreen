# ArcMac Lockscreen

This app is part of the ArcOS iMac: a mid-2010 21.5" iMac dedicated to running ArcOS, dubbed "the ArcMac." This app serves as the lockscreen for that mac, because the barebones linux installation doesn't come with one.

If you're running ArcOS in an electron app for whatever reason, then this app will come in handy, because it has checks as to only run in electron.

App created using the TPA system of ArcOS v7. Documentation about application development can be found [here](https://docs.arcapi.nl/).
